65-66 Horsemen

A large band of tough-looking horsemen accost the Warriors.  
Each Warrior must roll 1D6, adding +1 if the Warrior is riding a 
Horse and +2 if the Warrior is riding a Warhorse. The roll 
cannot be modified by any other means (Faith, etc.). Look up 
the result on the table below:
 
1-2 Your Warrior is no match for the horsemen and is 
	severely trampled and defeated. They relieve the 
	Warrior of an item of Treasure (determined randomly) 
	before galloping off. 

3-4 Your Warrior is beaten and humiliated. The horsemen 
	relieve them of 1D6x100 gold.

5-6 Your Warrior successfully keeps an eye on their purse 
	whilst managing to hold their own against the 
	brigands. The horsemen get nothing before they are 
	finally driven off. 
  
7 From atop their horse, your Warrior proves to be the 
	better rider and the better fighter. After dispatching a 
	few of the horsemen, the rest gallop away in fear.  
	Your Warrior finds 1D6x50 gold on the bodies of the 
	slain horsemen. 

8 In a glorious display of horsemanship and weaponry, 
	your Warrior humiliates many of the brigands. Once 
	the horsemen have been driven off, the Warrior 
	dismounts and loots the fallen for 1D6 x 10 gold and 
	one item of Dungeon Room Treasure!

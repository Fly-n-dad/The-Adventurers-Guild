33-34 Hungry Wolves

While traversing through a grove the Warriors are threatened 
by hungry wolves. The Warriors must toss a total of 2D3 food 
items to pacify the pack or the wild canines will attack.
 
If the Warriors don’t have enough food or if they choose not 
to feed them the Warriors eventually dispatch the attacking 
wolves. However, during the conflict each Warrior has one 
item of Equipment damaged beyond repair (determined 
randomly). It must be discarded immediately.

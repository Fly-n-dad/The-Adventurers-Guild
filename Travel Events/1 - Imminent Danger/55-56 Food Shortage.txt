55-56 Food Shortage

Whether through too many late nights carousing around the 
fire, carelessness, or simply throwing out supplies to carry 
more gold, the Warriors find themselves dealing with a 
dangerous food shortage.
 
Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. If the roll is a 1, the Warrior’s 
stamina is poor and their foraging skills awful. They are -1 
Toughness for the next Adventure. If the score is 2 or more, 
the Warrior’s constitution is sound and foraging skills are 
sufficient to sustain them.

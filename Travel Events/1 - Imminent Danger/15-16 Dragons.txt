15-16 Dragons

The Warriors spot a group of dragons up in the sky in the 
direction they are travelling. The dragons appear to be circling 
for prey. If the Warriors continue on their present course roll 
1D6 on the table below:
 
1 Attacked! As the Warriors near the area where the 
	dragons were spotted, they are viciously attacked by 
	the monsters! Although they manage to find refuge in 
	a small cave where they can tend to their injuries, each 
	Warrior must deduct -1 from their Starting Wounds 
	score permanently! 

2-3 Spotted! The dragons spot the Warriors approaching 
	and immediately swoop down on them to feast! 
	Although the Warriors take refuge in a dense forest, 
	the dragons wait patiently for them to re-emerge. The 
	Warriors have no choice but to alter their route which 
	adds another week to their journey. 

4-6 By the time the Warriors reach the area where they 
	had spotted the dragons, the beasts are no longer 
	there and the Warriors may continue on their journey 
	without delay. 
 
If the Warriors change course roll 1D6 below:
 
1-4 The way chosen adds a week to their journey.
 
5 The way chosen is the same distance with no loss of 
	time. 

6 The way chosen knocks a week off their journey!

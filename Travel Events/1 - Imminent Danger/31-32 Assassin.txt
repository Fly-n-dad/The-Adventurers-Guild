31-32 Assassin

While travelling on the road, one of the Warriors (determined 
randomly) is struck by a poisoned arrow fired from the 
bushes. The assailant promptly disappears without a trace.
 
 The poisoned Warrior is able to travel but must receive 
medical treatment from a healer as soon as possible. For every 
week the Warriors continue their journey, the poisoned Warrior 
must roll 1D6. If the result is a 1 or 2, then the Warrior must 
deduct -1 Wound from their Starting Wounds score 
permanently. If their Starting Wounds every reaches zero, or if 
they do not reach a Settlement, then they are dead and 
removed from the game. 
 
 If the Warrior reaches a Settlement, the local healer is able 
to cure their condition, although Wounds lost are permanent.

63-64 Hornet's Nest

The Warriors inadvertently disturb a hornet’s nest. The 
enraged insects attack the fleeing Warriors mercilessly. Each 
Warrior must roll 1D6 and add their Toughness. If the score is 
a 6 or less, the Warrior reacts so badly to the stings that they 
are -1 Strength until the end of the next Adventure.

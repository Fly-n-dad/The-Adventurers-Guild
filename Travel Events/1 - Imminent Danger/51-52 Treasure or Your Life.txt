51-52 Treasure or Your Life!

The Warriors are surrounded by a deadly and desperate group 
of highway robbers. The Warriors can either fight the robbers 
or give up an item of Treasure (your choice). 

If the Warriors decide to fight the highwaymen, each of 
them must roll 1D6 and add their Initiative. The total of all their 
scores represents the number of highway men they are facing. 
Next, roll 1D6 for each Warrior and add their Battle-level. The 
total of all those scores is how many highwaymen they defeat. 
If any highway robbers remain, the Warriors are overtaken, 
bound and left for the wolves. They are robbed of all of their 
gold and one Item of Treasure (chosen at random), but, 
thankfully, they manage to free themselves before they are 
devoured by wild animals.

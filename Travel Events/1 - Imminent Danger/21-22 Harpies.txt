21-22 Harpies

As the Warriors pass through some rocky crags, they are set 
upon by vicious harpies. They swoop in and claw at the 
Warriors and snatch some of their belongings before flying off. 
Each Warrior must roll 1D6 on the table below to see what 
they’ve lost:
 
1-2 A harpy snatches a random item of Treasure.
 
3-4 A harpy snatches a money pouch containing 1D6x100 
	gold. 

5-6 A harpy snatches a coin purse containing 1D6x20 
	gold.

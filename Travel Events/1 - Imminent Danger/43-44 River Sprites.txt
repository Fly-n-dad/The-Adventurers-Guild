43-44 River Sprites

Near an idyllic stream the Warriors encounter river sprites. 
These fairy-like, magical creatures with blue and pink skin sing 
beautiful songs but their kisses are fatal! 

Each Warrior must roll 1D6. On a roll of 1, they cannot avoid 
the magical temptation to kiss a sprite and the Warrior falls 
into a deathly slumber which can only be cured with a healing 
potion. 

For every week that the party continues to travel with their 
comatose companion, roll 2D6. If the result is a double 1, the 
Warrior has perished and must be removed from the game. 

If the Warriors reach a Settlement, the slumbering Warrior 
can be cured by a healer at the cost of 100 gold.

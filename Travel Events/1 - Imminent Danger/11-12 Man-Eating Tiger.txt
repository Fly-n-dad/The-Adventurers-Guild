11-12 Man-Eating Tiger

The Warriors learn of a royal edict which proclaims there to be 
a man-eating tiger on the loose in this area. Soon enough, one 
of the Warriors is attacked by the ferocious cat. Each Warrior 
must roll 2D6 and the lowest score is the Warrior who is 
attacked. Use the lowest rolling Warrior’s score on the table 
below to see what happens to them. If two or more Warriors 
have the same lowest score, they both are affected the same 
way! 

2 Before the group manages to bring down the big 
	beast, it takes your Warrior with it! Your Warrior has 
	been ripped to death and is removed from the game! 

3-4 Your Warrior is ripped, scratched, and bitten badly! 
	They must deduct -1 Wounds from their Starting 
	Wounds score permanently! 

5-7 Your Warrior draws steel just as the tiger pounces! 
	Wounded, the animal turns tail and runs away. 

8+ With a quick draw and thrust, your Warrior slices open 
	the huge cat’s belly and it falls dead! Amid the cat’s 
	innards your Warrior finds a ring worth 1D6x100 gold.

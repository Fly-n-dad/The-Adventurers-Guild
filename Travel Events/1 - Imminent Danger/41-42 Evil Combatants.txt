41-42 Evil Combatants

A group of evil combatants appear from round a bend. They 
have weapons drawn and it is clear they intend to attack. Roll 
1D6 to see who the combatants are:
 
1-2 Dark Elf Warriors
 
3-4 Chaos Warriors 

5-6 Chaos Dwarf Warriors 

 
The outcome of the fight is impossible to determine as 
combatants are of similar strength and ability to the Warriors.
 
Mix the Warrior counters into a cup. Starting with the party 
leader and continuing in turn, draw a counter out of the cup. If 
none of the Warriors draw their own counter, then it means 
that the Warriors have won the fight. They each receive an 
item of Dungeon Room Treasure. To determine how much gold 
they each receive, multiply the number rolled to determine the 
combatants by 100. For example, if you rolled a 2 (Dark Elves) 
then each Warrior receives 200 gold. 

If one of or more of the Warriors draw their own counter, 
then it means that the Warriors have lost the fight. They must 
each discard an item of Dungeon Room Treasure (determined 
randomly) and half of their gold.

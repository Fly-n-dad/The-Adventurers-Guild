45-46 Ambush

As the Warriors travel through a particularly dark glade in a 
gloomy forest, they are ambushed by Forest Goblins riding 
Giant Spiders. Leaping from the shadows, they threaten to 
overwhelm the hardy Warriors by sheer weight of numbers. 
Roll 1D6 for each Warrior on the following table:
 
1 Knocked out by a sneaky blow from behind, your 
	Warrior awakes to find one of their weapons (determine 
	randomly) and 2D6x100 gold stolen.
 
2 Knocked out by a sneaky blow from behind, your 
	Warrior awakes to find 2D6x100 pieces of their gold 
	stolen. 

3 Knocked out by a sneaky blow from behind, your 
	Warrior awakes to find one item of equipment stolen 
	(determine randomly).

	Goblins and gains 1D6x10 gold.

35-36 Village of the Damned

The Warriors enter what appears to be a deserted village. As 
they wander about scrounging for supplies, they find that the 
residents have mutated into Ghouls and Zombies! The 
Warriors had hoped to refill their waterskins and perhaps 
replenish their supplies. Now they only hope to escape with 
their lives!
 
Roll 1D6 for each Warrior and add their Strength. If the total 
is 7 or more, they have managed to fight their way out of the 
Settlement safely. If the total is 6 or less, the Warrior is clawed 
and scratched so badly by the afflicted townsfolk that they are 
either -1 Toughness or -1 Movement (their choice) for the next 
Adventure.

53-54 Witch Doctor

In a clearing, the Warriors are confronted by a grey-haired 
stranger with bulging eyes, wearing nothing but a loin cloth. A 
bone holds up his hair and brightly coloured feathers adorn his 
headdress. His actions are erratic and unpredictable as he 
motions to each of them. Each Warrior must roll 1D6 on the 
table below:
 
1-2 The Witch Doctor bestows the curse of the Evil Eye 
	upon your Warrior. The Warrior is -1 Strength for the 
	next Adventure unless they pay the Witch Doctor 
	1D6x50 gold to have the curse removed. 

3-4 The Witch Doctor curses your Warrior. They are -1 
	Weapon Skill for the next Adventure unless they pay 
	the Witch Doctor 1D6x25 gold. 

5-6 The Witch Doctor points at your Warrior sternly but 
	then gives them a potion. When drunk, it restores 1D6 
	Wounds.

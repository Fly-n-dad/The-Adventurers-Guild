23-24 Vanished

After a restful and relaxing night under the star lit sky, the 
Warriors awake to find something missing: one of the 
Warriors! Roll 1D6 for each Warrior with the lowest score 
being the Warrior who has disappeared.
 
After hours of fruitless searching, the other Warriors come 
to the solemn conclusion that their companion has vanished 
without a trace. They have no choice but to continue on 
toward the Settlement. 

In the first Dungeon Room of the next Adventure, the 
Warriors will come across their companion; gagged, bound and 
heavily guarded (make one roll on the Monster Table of the 
current Dungeon-level with the maximum number of Monsters 
appearing). Once all the Monsters in the room have been 
defeated, the Warrior may be freed. They have lost 1 Wound 
permanently from their Starting Wounds score due to the 
excruciating torture they have suffered. Their weapons, items 
and equipment are located in a heavy chest nearby although 
any gold they had is nowhere to be found.
 
Once free, the Warrior fights with unbridled ferocity as they 
seek revenge for their ordeal. The Warrior is +1 Attacks, -1 To 
Hit and +1 Strength for the rest of the Adventure. The Warrior 
receives an additional 10% gold for any Monster they defeat.
 
If the Warriors clear the Objective Room of Monsters, they 
succeed in restoring the Warrior’s honour. They each gain one 
Objective Room Treasure in addition to any other reward that 
they were entitled to.

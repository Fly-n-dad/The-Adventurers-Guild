25-26 Collapsing Bridge

The Warriors find themselves halfway across a bridge which 
spans across a deep chasm when they suddenly feel and hear 
the bridge starting to give way! The Warriors quickly begin a 
mad dash to the other side before the bridge collapses. Each 
Warrior must roll 1D6 on the table below: 

1 Your Warrior does not make it to other side before the 
	bridge collapses and they plummet into the chasm 
	below. They are dead and removed from the game.
 
2-3 Your Warrior is almost to other side when the bridge 
	crumbles. Your Warrior slams into the mountainside 
	suffering severe injuries in the process. They must 
	deduct -1 from their Starting Wounds score 
	permanently. Any mount they were riding is dead and 
	any wagon destroyed. The other Warriors manage to 
	reach their wounded comrade but they must add 
	another 1D3 weeks to the journey as they help the 
	injured Warrior along.  

4-6 The bridge gives way just before your Warrior reaches 
	the other side. In a dramatic fashion they (or their 
	mount) launch themself into the air and land safely on 
	the other side!

65-66 Battlefield

The area that the Warriors are travelling through was the site 
of many historic battles. Each Warrior may comb the area on 
the slim chance that they can uncover any weapons or armour 
that may have been left behind. Searching the battlefield is an 
arduous process, however, and will add another week to the 
Warriors’ journey. 

 Any Warrior who chooses to search can look for any item 
that is available at the Armourer, Fletcher or the 
Weaponsmith. Roll for stock as if in a Town but with a -2 
penalty (2D6-2). If the item is in stock, it means that your 
Warrior did indeed uncover it on the battlefield. However, the 
item has most likely been damaged in battle and is quite 
unusable. 

 If your Warrior takes the damaged item to a trader who 
sells ones like it, however, the trader will repair it for half the 
normal gold of the Cost (Buy) value listed. 

For example: if the Barbarian looks for a Leather Helm 
which has a stock number of 4. He rolls a 7 on 2D6 and 
subtracts the penalty -2 and so his final score is a 5. The stock 
roll for the item is a 4 which means that the Barbarian does 
find a broken Leather Helm on the battlefield. When he 
reaches the next Settlement, he visits the Armourer who 
repairs the item for 50 gold, which is half of the cost to buy a 
Leather Helm. The Barbarian now has a functioning Leather 
Helm that he can either wear, sell or give to another Warrior, 
etc.

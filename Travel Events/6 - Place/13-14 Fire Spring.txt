13-14 Fire Spring

From the top of a hill, the Warriors spot a beautiful spring 
down in the valley where they can quench their thirst. Upon 
reaching it, the Warriors discover a dancing blue fire burning 
just beneath the water. 

The Warriors realise that they have found the fabled 
weapon-quenching pool from an ancient Dwarf clan! 

Each Warrior may choose one weapon to thrust into the 
magical spring before rolling 1D6 on the table below: 

1 The weapon is now magical. 

2 The weapon can block one Attack once per Combat, 
	which completely negates any Damage the attack 
	would have caused. 

3 The weapon now adds +1 Damage when it strikes. 

4 The weapon now adds +1 Strength to the wielder. 

5 The weapon now conveys +1 Toughness to the wielder.
 
6 The weapon now causes an extra 1D6 Wounds the first 
time it hits in each combat. 
 
Roll another 1D6. If the score is a 6, the effect is permanent! 
On any other score, the weapon’s new effect lasts until the 
end of the next Adventure after which the weapon returns to 
normal.

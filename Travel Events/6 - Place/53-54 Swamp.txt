53-54 Swamp

As the Warriors pass by a vile swamp, they fail to notice a 
magical green mist that seeps from the murky waters and 
slowly moves toward them. The mist absorbs energy from 
everything in the vicinity and each Warrior finds that one of 
their magical weapons (their choice) has been drained of its 
magical properties. For all intents and purposes (including its 
Gold Value) the weapon functions as a non-magical weapon of 
its kind. At the end of the next Adventure it reverts back to its 
magical state.

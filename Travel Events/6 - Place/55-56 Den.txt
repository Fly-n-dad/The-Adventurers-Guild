55-56 Den

As the clouds grow dark and a savage rain begins falling 
down, the Warriors find a narrow entrance in the cliff face 
which opens up into a large cavern. As their eyes adjust to the 
darkness a horror grips them. Sleeping soundly in the middle 
of the cavern is a huge dragon surrounded by treasure.
 
Your Warrior can either exit safely through the narrow 
opening immediately or they can tempt fate and steal a 
treasure from the sleeping dragon, hoping it doesn’t wake up 
before the Warrior makes their escape. (A Halfling Thief 
cannot resist the temptation and must steal a treasure.)
 
If a Warrior opts to steal treasure, they must roll 1D6 on the 
table below: 

2 Loot in hand your Warrior almost makes it to the den 
	entrance before they are violently yanked back in by 
	the awakened dragon. Your Warrior screams their last 
	as the creature devours them. Remove the Warrior 
	from the game. 
 
3-6 On the verge of escaping, your Warrior trips at the 
	cavern opening, waking the dragon in the process. 
	Scrambling to their feet, your Warrior abandons all 
	thoughts of treasure and leaps from the cavern with 
	the enraged beast’s fiery breath close behind. Your 
	Warrior barely survives, empty-handed and badly 
	burnt and must deduct -1 Wounds from their Starting 
	Wounds score permanently. 

7+ Clutching a piece of treasure tightly, your Warrior 
	makes it to safety and the dragon lets out an ear-
	piercing roar from within. The item of Treasure is 
	yours! Roll another 1D6. If the score is 1, 2, 3 or 4 it is 
	a piece of Dungeon Room Treasure and if the score is 
	a 5 or 6 it is a piece of Objective Room Treasure.

25-26 Beautiful Grove

Within a beautiful grove the weary Warriors are befriended by 
an old sage. He invites the Warriors to rest and offers to take 
the Warriors on a spiritual journey. Intrigued, the Warriors take 
him up on his offer and each must roll 1D6 and add their 
Willpower and looking up the result on the table below:
 
5 or less. Your Warrior experiences horrid visions; demons 
	slash at their clothes, skeletons gouge at their eyes 
	and ghouls carry them away… they finally awaken, 
	but is visibly shaken by their experience. During the 
	next Adventure your Warrior is -1 To Hit and must 
	subtract -1 on all of their Fear and Terror rolls.
 
6-8 The insects are distracting, the wind is too cool and 
	the ground is too hard. Your Warrior is restless and 
	cannot seem to focus and learns nothing. 

9+ Your Warrior ends their meditation with a clear mind 
	and tempered soul. Your Warrior’s path in life is 
	clearer than ever. The next time your Warrior 
	advances in Battle-level and rolls for a skill (or 
	equivalent), they may add or subtract 1 from the dice 
	roll to see which skill they have learned.

33-34 Chasm

The Warriors’ path stops at the edge of a chasm where a 
pathetic, broken rope bridge dangles uselessly on the far side. 
There does seem to be a place for a rope to fasten on the 
other end, but it is across the chasm and far out of the 
Warriors’ reach. 

If the Warriors have a rope and a bow & arrow (or other 
throwing weapon), one of them can attach the rope to it and 
attempt to shoot (or throw) it across the chasm. The Warrior 
making the attempt must Make Difficult Shot (see the Action 
Table near the back of your Warrior’s Rulebook or page 166 of 
the Roleplay Book for any modifiers) by rolling To Hit with 
their Ballistic Skill. 

If the shot is successful, the Warriors may use the rope to 
crawl across the chasm. Each Warrior that crosses the chasm 
on the rope must roll to see if the rope breaks once they reach 
the other side. If it holds, the next Warrior can cross in the 
same manner. Of course, any Warrior who crosses the chasm 
in this manner must leave behind any horses and carts. 

If the shot misses (or if the rope breaks), the Warrior must 
discard the rope (and throwing weapon if applicable). Any 
Warrior still on the nearside of the chasm can repeat the 
process above with another projectile weapon and rope if they 
have them. 
 
Any Warrior who does not cross the chasm in manner must 
take the alternate route, which is an extremely rocky path 
around the mountain which adds two weeks to the journey.

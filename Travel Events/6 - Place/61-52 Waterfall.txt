61-62 Waterfall

As the path curves around the side of the mountain the 
Warriors find a majestic waterfall cascading down over the 
ledge they are walking along. As they pass underneath, the 
Warriors open their mouths and drink the refreshing water. 
Each Warrior may add an extra +1D6 Wounds to their Starting 
Wounds score until the end of the next Adventure. These 
extra Wounds cannot be healed and once taken they are lost 
forever.

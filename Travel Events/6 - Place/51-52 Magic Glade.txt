51-52 Magic Glade

As darkness falls, the Warriors stop in a glade to camp for the 
night. As they settle down to sleep, the Warriors feel soft 
magic flowing all around them which seems to permeate their 
bodies. 

Each Warrior must roll1D6 and may add that number to the 
Warrior’s Starting Wounds score for the next Adventure only. 
Throughout the Adventure these Wounds can be healed in the 
normal fashion but at the end of the Adventure, the Warrior’s 
Starting Wounds return to normal.

43-44 Mysterious Hollow

The Warriors travel through a misty hollow at the edge of a 
dense forest. Unable to see but a few inches in front of them 
for many hours, the Warriors become separated. Each Warrior 
must roll 1D6 on the table below: 

1 Your Warrior is completely lost and loses all hope of 
	finding a Settlement. They manage to meet up with the 
	other Warriors at the entrance to the next Dungeon.  

2 Your Warrior continues their journey to a Settlement 
	alone and will meet up with the other Warriors at the 
	entrance to the next Dungeon. 

3-4 Your Warrior resumes their journey alone but will meet 
	up with any other Warrior who finds the same size 
	Settlement as they do. 

5-6 Your Warrior quickly rendezvous with any other 
	Warrior who rolled this result and they may continue 
	their journey to a Settlement together.

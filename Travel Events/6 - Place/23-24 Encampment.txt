23-24 Encampment

The Warriors come upon the encampment of a small group of 
soldiers who are being deployed to a nearby province. They 
welcome the Warriors to sit and rest with them. 

Each Warrior may engage in military conversation with one 
of the soldiers in the encampment by rolling 1D6 below: 

1-3 The soldier is tired and does not wish to talk about 
	combat or weaponry. 

4-5 The soldier enjoys the Warrior’s company. He is 
	skilled in the art of weapon sharpening and, in a show 
	of friendship, offers to put a nice edge on your 
	Warrior’s blade. For the next Adventure, one of the 
	Warrior’s weapons (their choice) causes an extra 
	Wound each time it hits.
 
6 The soldier is quite taken with the Warrior and 
	excitedly discusses the fighting arts. The soldier is 
	skilled in defence with the blade and shows the 
	Warrior a new manuever. Once per combat, the 
	Warrior may attempt to turn aside a blow by rolling 
	1D6. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than 
	the attacker’s Strength, the blow is blocked and 
	causes no Damage.

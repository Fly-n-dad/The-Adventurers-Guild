63-64 Abandoned Mine

Against the hillside, the Warriors see an old, abandoned Dwarf 
mine. Something is gleaming from inside and the Warriors 
can’t resist examining further. Roll 1D6 on the table below:
 
1 The old mine is dangerous and unstable! It collapses 
	on the Warriors’ heads as they enter. If they have a 
	way of digging out of the cave-in, the Warriors 
	eventually exit and continue on their journey. If not, 
	then the Warriors only exit lies straight ahead through 
	the mines. They must proceed directly into the next 
	Adventure. 

2-3 The old mine collapses on the Warriors’ heads just as 
	they enter. They manage to escape the falling debris 
	but in their haste one of the Warriors (determined 
	randomly) drops an item of Treasure (determined 
	randomly) which disappears under the rubble. 

4-5 The gleaming light is indeed gold! The Warriors rush in 
	and begin digging, managing to scrounge up 1D6x10 
	gold each. 

6 The gleaming light is coming from a vein of gold! The 
	Warriors have hit the mother lode and they manage to 
	extract 1D6x100 gold each!

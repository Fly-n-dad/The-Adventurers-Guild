41-42 Checkpoint

The Warriors arrive at a military checkpoint set up by the lord 
of the region to combat the bandits that have been attacking 
travellers on the road between cities.
 
The soldiers are certain that the Warriors are of ill repute 
and will not let them pass. Moreover, the Sergeant wants all of 
them arrested and taken to the nearby village for 
interrogation. The Warriors must choose amongst them who 
will step forward and “convince” the sergeant that the 
Warriors are not bandits. 

That Warrior must make a Bluffing Enemies (see the Action 
Table near the back of your Warrior’s Rulebook or page 166 of 
the Roleplay Book for any modifiers) by rolling 1D6 with the 
result on the table below: 

5 or less. The Sergeant is incensed that the Warriors would try 
	to lie their way through the checkpoint. All the 
	Warriors are immediately arrested and taken to a 
	nearby Village where their journey ends. Here they 
	must pay 1D6x50 gold each or be jailed for 2 weeks 
	until they are cleared of charges.  Remember: if the 
	Warriors do not immediately embark on the next 
	Adventure, they must make one roll on the 
	Catastrophic Events Table!
 
6-8 The Sergeant realizes that the Warriors are respectful 
	citizens and allow them to pass with no loss of time.
 
9+ After being told an elaborate story full of 
	embellishments and exaggerated metaphors the 
	Sergeant arranges for a guide. Surely such noble and 
	fantastic warriors must not be detained on their way 
	to glorious battles with foul and detestable monsters! 
	The Warriors’ journey is reduced by 1 week and they 
	may upgrade the size of the Settlement they were 
	headed to (a Village to a Town or a Town to a City)!

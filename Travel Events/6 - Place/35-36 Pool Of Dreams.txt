35-36 Pool Of Dreams

The Warriors come across a deep pool of freezing water on top 
of a mountain; reflecting like a mirror, with shifting images 
drifting across its still, icy surface.  As the Warriors gaze into 
the chill waters, they see twisted reflections of themselves 
fighting for their lives against the most hideous Monsters. 
Each Warrior must roll 1D6 on the following table: 

1-3 Although they can see these reflections, your Warrior 
	cannot make any sense of them. 

4-6 Your Warrior realises that they are being granted a 
	vision of the future! At any time during the next 
	Adventure, they may ignore any one blow that would 
	otherwise hit them. Your Warrior recognises the blow 
	before it hits home as the vision from the pool, and 
	dodges away just in time.

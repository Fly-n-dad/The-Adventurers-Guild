11-12 Graveyard

The Warriors come across strangely expansive yet obviously 
neglected graveyard just outside of a meagre village. A soft, 
haunting wailing drifts out from amongst the tombstones 
setting the hair on the Warriors’ necks on end before the 
shimmering spectre of an armoured woman appears just 
beyond the gateway to the graveyard, beckoning to one of the 
Warriors. 

Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The spectre leads the Warrior 
with the highest score to a treasure that has long kept hidden 
within the mausoleum. Roll 2D6 to determine what treasure 
the spectre guarding now gives to the Warrior: 

1 A fine cloak worth 15 gold pieces. 

2-3 1D6x50 gold. 

4-5 One item of Dungeon Room Treasure. 

6 One item of Objective Room Treasure.

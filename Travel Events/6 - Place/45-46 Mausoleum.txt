45-46 Mausoleum

As the Warriors search for a safe place to camp on a moonless 
night, they take sanctuary inside an old stone house which is 
in a fact a weathered mausoleum. A ghost materialises and 
accuses the Warriors of being the ones responsible for the 
mausoleum’s state of disrepair. The ghost demands that each 
Warrior pay 1D6x20 gold to its living relatives to help them 
rebuild the tomb (selling items of Equipment or Treasure if 
necessary) or it will curse them. 

When the Warriors reach the next Settlement, they may 
seek out and donate the amount to the ghost’s living relatives 
by following the rules for finding a Special Location. Any 
Warrior who does not find the relatives and donate the 
required amount is cursed by the ghost and they are -1 Luck 
for the next Adventure.

21-22 Garden

The Warriors notice a small wooden gate just off the main 
path which leads to a lush garden filled with ripe vegetables. 
The Warriors load their packs from the abundant crops 
growing in the garden and eat well for several days thereafter. 
Full of renewed vigour, the Warriors are able to travel at a 
faster pace and thus reduce their journey time by one week.

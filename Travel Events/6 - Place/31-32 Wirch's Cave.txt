31-32 Witch's Cave

Deep in a gloomy ravine the Warriors come across the 
entrance to a dark cave. Inside it dwells a twisted, ugly hag 
who claims to be a witch. 

Each Warrior may purchase a single potion by paying the 
woman 1D6x10 gold (it must be drunk immediately). Roll 1D6 
on the following table: 

1 Your Warrior falls unconscious, writhing in agony as if 
	a fire were burning through them. When they awaken 
	they feel deathly weak. They are -1 Toughness for the 
	duration of the next Adventure. 

2-4 The potion warms your Warrior to the core. They gain 
	+1D6 Wounds for the duration of the next Adventure. 

5-6 A powerful heat surges through your Warrior, and they 
	feel energy coursing through their muscles and sinews. 
	They are +1 Toughness for the duration of the next 
	Adventure.
